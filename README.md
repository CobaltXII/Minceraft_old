# Minceraft

Minceraft is a clone of Minecraft written in C++11 using SDL2 and OpenGL 3.2. Minceraft aims to replicate the feel, look and environment of the old Minecraft Alpha and Beta versions. I remember playing the Alpha and Beta versions of Minecraft as they were released. The green grass, blocky lighting, hungerless player and challenging mobs made the Alpha and Beta versions of Minecraft have a special look and feel. The new Minecraft can simply not recreate the feeling of coming back to your cobblestone base and seeing all your wheat fresh and ready to harvest. Or the feeling of finding diamonds for the first time. Or the feeling of digging straight down and falling into a pit of lava. You could run the old versions using the Minecraft launcher, but those are slow, buggy and jittery when run on newer computers. Minceraft aims to solve all of these problems and bring back the special environment of Minecraft Alpha and Beta.
